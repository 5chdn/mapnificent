Install [bower](http://bower.io/) and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

    # You need node and npm
    npm install -g bower
    # You need ruby and bundler
    bundler install
    # Python dependency to come shortly!

Then run:

    bower install

Tiles are currently hardcoded to be served from a local tilestream server. Sorry!
